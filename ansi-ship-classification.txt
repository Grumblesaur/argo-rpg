ANSI Vessel Classification System

The ANSI vessel classification system designates each class of ship with an alphanumeric string
consisting of separate blocks to indicate the performance, size, and capability of the indicated
vessel. Each vessel legally registered by a corporation of the United States of America is
required to broadcast its classification string from its transponder, as it was indicated by
manufacturer specifications at time of purchase. If the ship has been modified since its
classification string was created, the vessel must undergo inspection and be reclassified by a
licensed authority.

Most important are the range, sector, and crew complement specifications. In addition to being
broadcast via transponder in the vicinity of spaceports, stations, and colonies, these portions
must be recorded on all documentation pertaining to the ship. All fields must be available in a
vessel's transponder data packets, though not all documentation will require them. Various port
authorities will use these designations at their own discretion.


The format for a ship's type is long-form:
<Range><Sector> <Crew Complement>:<Cargo Capacity>:<Passenger Capacity> <Armament>

Short-form:
<Range><Sector>-<Crew Complement><Cargo Capacity><Passenger Capacity>-<Armament>

The FHS Foresight, for example, can use either of the following designations.
SC llc:mlf:ntp hpt:deb:exg:kco:kma:cme
SC-3DP-BEGJKM

A hefty intersystem munitions freighter owned by a military force  might have designations
like these:
IM hhc:hfrx:ntp hpt:exg:deb:cme
IM-7J1P-BEGM

The Apollo spacecraft could have designations such as these:
OG ulc:nfr:ntp una tra
OG-1AP-U-T

Voyager:
IG umc:nfr:ntp una
IG-0AP-U

No shortcode has been supplied for ahc-type ships, since they'd be so massive that sending a
short-form code would undermine their majesty, as decided by committee.

crew or passenger luggage. 1 Murph (mrf) = 10 cubic meters.

Absurdly heavy barge (abg) [ ]: >10,000,000 mrf

No shortcode has been supplied for abg-type ships, since they'd be so massive that sending a
short-form code would undermine their majesty, as decided by committee.


These designations may have additional characters appended, for when a ship is designed for special
payloads, and the lack of indication of such a design while carrying a restricted variety of cargo
would result in a violation of commerce laws:

Munitions, explosives        (x) [1]
Climate controlled cargo bay (c) [2]
Medical supplies             (b) [3]
